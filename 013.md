# Malicious Borrower can create a scenario where it won't be possible to repay() or harvest() on his borrowingKey

## Summary
The borrower could pack so much loans to his borrowing key so as to gas grief the contracts whenever repay() and harvest() is done on the borrowing key.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue here lies in the borrow() function where the 
1.  loans[] to be provided in `BorrowParams` is a dynamic array and 
2. there is no check to confirm the existence of the tokenIds passed in.
```solidity
 function borrow(
        BorrowParams calldata params, // @audit-issue
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256)
    {
```

```solidity
 struct BorrowParams {
        /// @notice The pool fee level for the internal swap
        uint24 internalSwapPoolfee;
        /// @notice The address of the token that will be sold to obtain the loan currency
        address saleToken;
        /// @notice The address of the token that will be held
        address holdToken;
        /// @notice The minimum amount of holdToken that must be obtained
        uint256 minHoldTokenOut;
        /// @notice The maximum amount of margin deposit that can be provided
        uint256 maxMarginDeposit;
        /// @notice The maximum allowable daily rate
        uint256 maxDailyRate;
        /// @notice The SwapParams struct representing the external swap parameters
        SwapParams[] externalSwap;
        /// @notice An array of LoanInfo structs representing multiple loans
        LoanInfo[] loans; //@audit-issue dynamic array
    }
```

```solidity
 struct LoanInfo {
        uint128 liquidity;
        uint256 tokenId;// @audit-issue no check whatsoever to confirm existence of token 
    }
```

Now a borrower could pass in so much loans that's enough to gas grief the contract whenever there's an iteration through loans.length of his borrowingKey.

```solidity
 function _addKeysAndLoansInfo(
        bytes32 borrowingKey,
        LoanInfo[] memory sourceLoans
    ) private returns (uint256 pushCounter) {
        // Get the storage reference to the loans array for the borrowing key
        LoanInfo[] storage loans = loansInfo[borrowingKey];
        // Iterate through the sourceLoans array
        for (uint256 i; i < sourceLoans.length; ) {
            // Get the current loan from the sourceLoans array
            LoanInfo memory loan = sourceLoans[i];
            // Get the storage reference to the tokenIdLoansKeys array for the loan's token ID
            if (tokenIdToBorrowingKeys[loan.tokenId].add(borrowingKey)) {
                // Push the current loan to the loans array
                loans.push(loan);
                pushCounter++;
```


Whenever these spam loans thats attached to the malicious borrower's borrowingKey is iterated through there will be a DOS 
## Impact
Borderline HIgh because there could be some legit tokenIds among the spam tokenids used by the malicious borrower when calling borrow() and the lenders of those loans won't be able to harvest the fees accumulated on their loans. This is due to the harvest() function running out of gas whenever it tries iterating through the spam loans.
```solidity
    LoanInfo[] memory loans = loansInfo[borrowingKey];
        // Iterate through each loan in the loans array.
        for (uint256 i; i < loans.length; ) {
            LoanInfo memory loan = loans[i];
            // Get the owner address of the loan's token ID using the underlyingPositionManager contract.
            address creditor = _getOwnerOf(loan.tokenId);
```

This may also DOS liquidations in the repay() function whenever the spam loans are iterated through in `_removeKeysAndClearStorage()` causing bad debt for the protocol
```solidity
 function _removeKeysAndClearStorage(
        address borrower,
        bytes32 borrowingKey,
        LoanInfo[] memory loans
    ) private {
        // Remove the borrowing key from the tokenIdToBorrowingKeys mapping for each loan in the loans array.
        for (uint256 i; i < loans.length; ) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Here's how this can be prevented.

1. put a max cap on the amount of loans that be used  when calling the borrow() function
2. check and ensure the tokenId's used when calling borrow() exists. This can be done by ensuring the owner's of the tokenIds isn't address(0).
