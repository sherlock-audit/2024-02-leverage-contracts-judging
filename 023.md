# Loans cannot be liquidated by other users by calling repay function

## Summary
The `repay` function serves the purpose of repaying loans, optionally facilitating liquidation or emergency liquidity withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
While the `repay` function is designed for loan repayment, liquidation, and emergency liquidity withdrawal, it currently restricts access only to the borrower.

## Impact
As the `repay` function can only be called by the borrower, it creates a vulnerability that can potentially result in bad debt within the protocol.

## Code Snippet
This will revert when the statement is true.
