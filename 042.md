# Wrong conditional statement in `LightQuoterV3:_simulateSwap`

## Summary
In the while loop within `LightQuoterV3:_simulateSwap`, the && operator is utilized to evaluate two distinct conditions: `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining != 0` and `state.sqrtPriceX96 != cache.sqrtPriceX96Limit`. This implies that the loop will persist even if only  `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining = 0` or only when price limit is reached 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_simulateSwap` swap function ensures that the simulation continues only if there is still an amount left to be swapped and also ensures that ensures that the simulation stops if the price reaches the limit set by `sqrtPriceX96Limit`. These to conditions are independent variables but the while loop using the `&&` statement will only stop when both `state.amountSpecifiedRemaining != 0` and  `state.sqrtPriceX96 = cache.sqrtPriceX96Limit`. 

## Impact
This will cause simulation to continue when there is 0 amount left and price Limit has not being reached and vice versa

## Recommendation
`while (
   -         state.amountSpecifiedRemaining != 0 && state.sqrtPriceX96 != cache.sqrtPriceX96Limit
        )
+      state.amountSpecifiedRemaining != 0  ||  state.sqrtPriceX96 != cache.sqrtPriceX96Limit
