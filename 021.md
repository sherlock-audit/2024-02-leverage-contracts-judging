# It can be front-running when the position owner calls the `repay` function to withdraw liquidity in an emergency situation.

## Summary
Liquidity withdrawal can be prevented by front-running on `repay` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The owner of the position calls repay function to withdraw his liquidity in an emergency state.
However if `collateralBalance>=0` repay function is reverted when the owner of the position calls repay function.

collateralBalance is calculated as follows.

```solidity
function _calculateCollateralBalance(
        uint256 borrowedAmount,
        uint256 borrowingAccLoanRatePerShare,
        uint256 borrowingDailyRateCollateral,
        uint256 accLoanRatePerSeconds
    ) internal pure returns (int256 collateralBalance, uint256 currentFees) {
        if (borrowedAmount > 0) {
            currentFees = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
                borrowedAmount,
                accLoanRatePerSeconds - borrowingAccLoanRatePerShare,
                Constants.BP
            );
89          collateralBalance = int256(borrowingDailyRateCollateral) - int256(currentFees);
        }
    }
```

Therefore, when the malicious borrower captures the repay function of the position owner in the mempool, it increases the gas cost and calls the `increaseCollateralBalance` function.

The `LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#increaseCollateralBalance` function is as follows.

```solidity
function increaseCollateralBalance(
        bytes32 borrowingKey,
        uint256 collateralAmt,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external checkDeadline(deadline) {
        BorrowingInfo storage borrowing = borrowingsInfo[borrowingKey];
        // Ensure that the borrowed position exists and the borrower is the message sender
        (borrowing.borrowedAmount == 0 || borrowing.borrower != address(msg.sender)).revertError(
            ErrLib.ErrorCode.INVALID_BORROWING_KEY
        );
        // Increase the daily rate collateral balance by the specified collateral amount
        borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance +=
            collateralAmt *
            Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
        _pay(borrowing.holdToken, msg.sender, VAULT_ADDRESS, collateralAmt);
        emit IncreaseCollateralBalance(msg.sender, borrowingKey, collateralAmt);
    }
```

As you could see, `borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance` is increased by the `increaseCollateralBalance` function. Therefore, in the `_calculateCollateralBalance` function, `collateralBalance` is set to be greater than 0.
As a result, repay function is reverted and the owner of the position may not withdraw his liquidity.
## Impact
Position holders cannot withdraw liquidity and may incur losses on his liquidity.

## Recommendation
Specify gasLimit for the repay function.
