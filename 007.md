# Precision loss in liquidation bonus

## Summary
There is possible precision loss in the `LiquidityBorrowingManager::getLiquidationBonus` function due to division before multiplication, which can result in users receiving less bonus liquidation than they should.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `LiquidityBorrowingManager` contract, there is a function `getLiquidationBonus`, which calculates the liquidation bonus for a given token, borrowed amount, and times factor. The liquidation bonus can suffer from precision loss due to division before multiplication.

```javascript
    /**
     * @dev Calculates the liquidation bonus for a given token, borrowed amount, and times factor.
     * @param token The address of the token.
     * @param borrowedAmount The amount of tokens borrowed.
     * @param times The times factor to apply to the liquidation bonus calculation.
     * @return liquidationBonus The calculated liquidation bonus.
     */
    function getLiquidationBonus(
        address token,
        uint256 borrowedAmount,
        uint256 times
    ) public view returns (uint256 liquidationBonus) {
        // Retrieve liquidation bonus for the given token
        Liquidation memory liq = liquidationBonusForToken[token];

        if (liq.bonusBP == 0) {
            // If there is no specific bonus for the token
            // Use default bonus
            liq.minBonusAmount = Constants.MINIMUM_AMOUNT;
            liq.bonusBP = dafaultLiquidationBonusBP;
        }
@>    liquidationBonus = (borrowedAmount * liq.bonusBP) / Constants.BP;

        if (liquidationBonus < liq.minBonusAmount) {
            liquidationBonus = liq.minBonusAmount;
        }
@>   liquidationBonus *= (times > 0 ? times : 1);
    }
```

Here, the `liquidationBonus` is divided by `Constants.BP` which is defined as `uint256 internal constant BP = 10000;`. However, if the a positive number is passed for `times`, then the `liquidationBonus` is multiplied by that number and returned. 

## Impact
Users receiving less bonus liquidation than they should.
