# The implementation of function _checkEntranceFee means that entryFeeBP can never be 1


## Summary

The implementation of function _checkEntranceFee means that entryFeeBP can never be 1

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract will utilize the _checkEntranceFee function to verify and retrieve the entryFeeBP. If entryFeeBP equals 0, it will return the default value (10), whereas if entryFeeBP equals 1, it will return 0. Therefore, the current implementation means that the entryFeeBP of contract can not be 1, that is, the entry fees of the contract can never be 0.01%.

## Impact

The entry fees of the contract can never be 0.01%.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use other value to represent disabled entry fees, for example, any value larger than MAX_ENTRANCE_FEE_BPS.
