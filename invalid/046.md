# Gas griefing on loan owners for their liquidity

## Summary
Gas griefing on loan owners for their liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail
The `repay()` function allows for emergency liquidity withdrawal. 

> In the event of liquidation, the liquidity provider whose liquidity is present in the traderâ€™s position can use the emergency mode and withdraw their liquidity.

However, certain loan owners will pay more to execute this withdrawal than others due to the way it's performed.
This is calculated in the `_calculateEmergencyLoanClosure()`:
```solidity
function _calculateEmergencyLoanClosure(
        bool zeroForSaleToken,
        bytes32 borrowingKey,
        uint256 totalfeesOwed,
        uint256 totalBorrowedAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 removedAmt, uint256 feesAmt, bool completeRepayment) {
        ...
        LoanInfo[] storage loans = loansInfo[borrowingKey];
        // Iterate through each loan in the loans array.
        for (uint256 i; i < loans.length; ) {
            LoanInfo memory loan = loans[i];
            // Get the owner address of the loan's token ID using the underlyingPositionManager contract.
            address creditor = _getOwnerOf(loan.tokenId);
            // Check if the owner of the loan's token ID is equal to the `msg.sender`.
            if (creditor == msg.sender) {
                // If the owner matches the `msg.sender`, replace the current loan with the last loan in the loans array
                // and remove the last element.
                loans[i] = loans[loans.length - 1];
                loans.pop();
                // Remove the borrowing key from the tokenIdToBorrowingKeys mapping.
                tokenIdToBorrowingKeys[loan.tokenId].remove(borrowingKey);
                // Update the liquidity cache based on the loan information.
                _upNftPositionCache(zeroForSaleToken, loan, cache);
                // Add the holdTokenDebt value to the removedAmt.
                removedAmt += cache.holdTokenDebt;
                // Calculate the fees amount based on the total fees owed and holdTokenDebt.
                feesAmt += FullMath.mulDiv(totalfeesOwed, cache.holdTokenDebt, totalBorrowedAmount);
            } else {
                // If the owner of the loan's token ID is not equal to the `msg.sender`,
                // the function increments the loop counter and moves on to the next loan.
                unchecked {
                    ++i;
                }
            }
        }
        ...
    }
   ```
As you can see, It Iterate through each loan in the loans array and check for the owner of each loan and compare them to find the loan that's for the owner currently executing it, this means for loan owners whose loan has been added to the ending part of the array will either have to pay more for gas transaction compared to others or have to wait and hope that others execute theirs.
## Impact
owners at the end of the borrower's loan array will pay more gas than others to remove their liquidity

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider a way to allow loan owners to simply specify the borrowerkey and loan tokenIds.
