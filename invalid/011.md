# Spender can front-run `approve`

## Summary
The `_maxApproveIfNecessary` function checks if a spender's is less than a specific amount. If true, it attempts to approve the allowance to the maximum possible value. A spender can exploit this by quickly spending all of their allowance when they see the transaction in the mempool. Once the transaction goes through, their allowance is reset to the max amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_maxApproveIfNecessary`  checks if a spender's allowance is less than a specific amount, before restoring it to the maximum value. However, the spender can see the transaction that resets their allowance prior to it happening, by observing the mempool. They can quickly spend all of their allowance before it gets restored to the maximum value.

## Impact
Loss of pool tokens.
