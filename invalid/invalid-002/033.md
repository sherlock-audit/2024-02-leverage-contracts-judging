# A lack of slippage protection can lead to significant loss of user fund

## Summary
pool Manager contracts interact with Uniswap V3 in multiple areas of the code. However, none of these interactions contain any [slippage control](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-no-slippage-parameter). This means, the contract, and by extension, all users who hold shares, can lose a significant value due to liquid pools or MEV sandwich attacks every time any of the relevant functions are called.
## Vulnerability Detail
In below instances, a call to Uniswap V3 is made. Calls amount0Min and amount1Min are each set to 0, which allows for a 100% slippage tolerance. This means, that the action could lead to the caller losing up to 100% of their tokens due to slippage.
 function _increaseLiquidity(
        address saleToken,
        address holdToken,
        LoanInfo memory loan,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1
    ) private {
        // Call the increaseLiquidity function of underlyingPositionManager contract
        // with IncreaseLiquidityParams struct as argument
        (uint128 restoredLiquidity, , ) = underlyingPositionManager.increaseLiquidity(
            INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: loan.tokenId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
           @ >   amount0Min: 0,
           @>     amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
        // Check if the restored liquidity is less than the loan liquidity amount
        // If true, revert with InvalidRestoredLiquidity exception
        if (restoredLiquidity < loan.liquidity) {
            // Get the balance of holdToken and saleToken
            (uint256 holdTokentBalance, uint256 saleTokenBalance) = _getPairBalance(
                holdToken,
                saleToken
            );

            revert InvalidRestoredLiquidity(
                loan.tokenId,
                loan.liquidity,
                restoredLiquidity,
                amount0,
                amount1,
                holdTokentBalance,
                saleTokenBalance
            );
        }
    }
## Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-leverage-contracts/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/LiquidityManager.sol#L385 . Since it lacks  slippage control, every user who interacts with any pools Manager.sol vault will risk having their funds stolen by MEV bots.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For each vulnerable function, allow the caller to specify values for amount0Min and amount1Min instead of setting them to 0.
