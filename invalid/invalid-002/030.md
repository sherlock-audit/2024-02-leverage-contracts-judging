## Vulnerability Detail

Note: this issue happened on the deployed version of GoodEntry and was discovered when using https://alpha.goodentry.io/

Due to incorrect parameters and validation when working with UniV3 LP the vault may enter a state where rebalancing reverts. This means any deposits and withdrawals from the vault become unavailable.


## Impact
 lack of slippage protection can lead to a significant loss of user funds. A call to Uniswap V3 is made. Calls amount0Min and amount1Min are each set to 0, which allows for a 100% slippage tolerance. This means, that the action could lead to the caller losing up to 100% of their tokens due to slippage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For each vulnerable function, allow the caller to specify values for `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` instead of setting them to 0.
