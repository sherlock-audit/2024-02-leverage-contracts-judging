# Creditors will Loose harvest if a user repays their loan before they can claim harvest

## Summary
If a user repays their loan before creditors can claim harvest, creditors will lose harvest rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user repays their loan before creditors can, the borrowing key associated with the user loan is deleted. Consequently, the harvest function cannot be invoked, preventing creditors from claiming harvest rewards.

## Impact
This vulnerability results in a loss of profit for creditors who expected to receive harvest rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the `harvest` function to be invoked even when a user repays their debt. This adjustment ensures that creditors can claim harvest rewards regardless of the timing of loan repayments and harvest claims, thereby preventing loss of profit.
