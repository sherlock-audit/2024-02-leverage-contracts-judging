# Approve batch transaction fails revert

## Summary
USDT on Ethereum mainnet is non-standard and requires resetting the approval to zero
(see USDT L199) before being able to change it again
if a approve fail then the approve transactions will all revert 

## Vulnerability Detail
`_callExternalSwap` calls `_maxApproveIfNecessary` that can revert when approve usdt to a non-zero value before setting it to a
 zero 

## Impact
funds can be locked in contract and the approve of funds or transfer will fail

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
do a safeApprove(0) first before the approvalor ensure that the exact approved amount is always transferred.
Recommend to use safeApprove instead and set the allowance to 0 before calling it. Check if token address is USDT before using this function :
```diff
+    function approveUnderlyingUDT(address spender) private {
     
+           IERC20(tokens).safeApprove(spender, 0);
+           IERC20(tokens).safeApprove(spender, type(uint256).max);
      
+ }
```
