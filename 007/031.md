# check usdt approve to zero

## Summary
There are 3 instances where the IERC20.approve() function is called only once without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0). 

## Vulnerability Detail
Transactions will revert 

## Impact
Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT.
Some token contracts do not return any value.
Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-leverage-contracts/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/abstract/ApproveSwapAndPay.sol#L66

USDT approve method (it checks that allowance is zero):

function approve(
    address _spender,
    uint _value
    ) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
...
    require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
...
}


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend doing approve(0) before calling the main approve (currently OpenZeppelin contracts have this logic https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/a714fe6dbd84d1f8016cce922fb719494afa9ba2/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L52).

Recommend to use safeApprove instead and set the allowance to 0 before calling it.

    function approveUnderlying(address spender) private {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeApprove(spender, 0);
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeApprove(spender, type(uint256).max);
        }
    }
