# Min fee enforcement can cause borrowers to pay too many fees

## Summary
The min fee enforcement mechanism `_calcFeeCompensationUpToMin()` in `repay()` can cause borrowers to pay too many fees.
## Vulnerability Detail
The code below in `repay()` enforces a min fee payment per loan:
```solidity
            if (collateralBalance > 0) {
                uint256 compensation = _calcFeeCompensationUpToMin(
                    collateralBalance,
                    currentFees,
                    borrowing.feesOwed
                );
                currentFees += compensation;
```
```solidity
    function _calcFeeCompensationUpToMin(
        int256 collateralBalance,
        uint256 currentFees,
        uint256 feesOwed
    ) private pure returns (uint256 compensation) {
        uint256 minimum = Constants.MINIMUM_AMOUNT * Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
        uint256 total = currentFees + feesOwed;
        if (total < minimum) {
            compensation = minimum - total;
            if (uint256(collateralBalance) < compensation) {
                compensation = uint256(collateralBalance);
            }
        }
    }
```
But if the min fee has already been collected and `borrowing.feesOwed` is below the minimum fee, for example if `harvest()` was just called, then the borrower's collateral will be reduced by the min fee again and it will be paid to the lender a second time.
## Impact
Borrowers pay too many fees. Lenders can frontrun `repay()` to steal some extra fees.

## Recommendation
This could be tricky to fix, one possible solution is to track whether or not the min fee has been collected for a loan and conditionally waive the min fee enforcement in `repay()`.
