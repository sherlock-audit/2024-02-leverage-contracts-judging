# When the creditors of some loan.tokenId is Address(0), part of the fees will be locked in the protocol

## Summary

When the creditors of some loan.tokenId is Address(0), part of the fees will be locked in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

In reapy function, the feesOwed incurred for borrowing will be distributed to the creditors of the loan.tokenId. However, if some creditors of loan.tokenId is Address(0), the corresponding fees will not be distributed to anyone, resulting in locked fees. The relevant core code is as follows:

```solidity
function _restoreLiquidity(
    RestoreLiquidityParams memory params,
    LoanInfo[] memory loans
) internal {
    NftPositionCache memory cache;

    for (uint256 i; i < loans.length; ) {
        // Update the cache for the current loan
        LoanInfo memory loan = loans[i];
        // Get the owner of the Nonfungible Position Manager token by its tokenId
        address creditor = _getOwnerOf(loan.tokenId);
        // Check that the token is not burned
        if (creditor != address(0)) {
            // ......

            loansFeesInfo[creditor][cache.holdToken] += liquidityOwnerReward;
        }

        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact
